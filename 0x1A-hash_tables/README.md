# Hash Tables in C - project 0x1A.c - Hash Tables

## Introduction

This project aims to implement hash tables in C, exploring the concepts of hash functions, collision handling, and the overall use of hash tables. The project provides a hands-on experience in understanding the fundamentals of hash tables and their applications.

## Learning Objectives

### General

1. **Hash Function:**
   - Understand the concept of a hash function.
   - Identify the characteristics of a good hash function.

2. **Hash Table:**
   - Define what a hash table is.
   - Explain the working principles of hash tables and how to use them.

3. **Collisions:**
   - Define collisions in the context of a hash table.
   - Explore strategies for handling collisions.

4. **Advantages and Drawbacks:**
   - Recognize the advantages and drawbacks of using hash tables.

5. **Use Cases:**
   - Identify common use cases for hash tables.

### Project Requirements

1. **Coding Environment:**
   - Use vi, vim, or emacs as editors.
   - Compile on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc with options: -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89.

2. **Coding Style:**
   - Adhere to the Betty style.
   - Utilize betty-style.pl and betty-doc.pl for code formatting.

3. **File Organization:**
   - Include a README.md file at the root.
   - Ensure code files end with a new line.
   - Create a header file named `hash_tables.h` with function prototypes.

4. **Coding Practices:**
   - Avoid global variables.
   - Limit each file to no more than 5 functions.

5. **Libraries and Headers:**
   - Use the C standard library.
   - Include header guards for all header files.

### Data Structures

1. **Structures:**
   - Utilize provided data structures: `hash_node_t` and `hash_table_t`.

### Project Implementation

1. **Functions:**
   - Implement functions for hash table operations.
   - Handle key insertion, value retrieval, and collision resolution.

2. **Header File:**
   - Include function prototypes in `hash_tables.h`.
   - Ensure proper header guards.

### Tests

1. **Collaborative Testing:**
   - Work collaboratively on a set of tests to validate the implementation.

### Python Dictionaries

1. **Understanding Python Dictionaries:**
   - Recognize that Python dictionaries are implemented using hash tables.
   - Relate the project implementation to the underlying mechanisms of Python dictionaries.
